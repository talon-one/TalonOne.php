# PHP SDK for Talon.One Integration API

Currently, this demo only requires the cURL PHP module.

# Test it

To test the integration, you need to create an application in the Talon.One Campaign Manager and find out its ID and application key.
Paste these values and your subdomain name in the right places in talondemo.php and run it:

    php talondemo.php
